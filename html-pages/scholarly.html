                The application offers a modern interface that is visually pleasing to enhance the user experience.
                FePA can be used on both large screens and on the browser of a phone with a smaller screen size,

        <h2>Source Code</h2>
        <p>
            For source code management of the project <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> was used.
            Commits are made by both team members. For most pages, a separate branch was created on which code was
            updated by both members, so the most recent push always contains the latest version of the code.
        </p>
        <p>
            The source code of the project will be available <a href="https://github.com/VadanaAndrei/Web2024"
                target="_blank">here</a>
            when it is made public.

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <section>
            <h2>SQL Injection</h2>
            <p>
                The site will prevent SQL Injection attacks. The user will not be allowed to enter special characters
                such as ', with the verification being done at the server level. Thus, SQL code will not be able to run
                in the database when a user is created or any other interaction where a new record is added/modified in
                the database.

        <section id="user-interface" role="doc-introduction">
            <h2>Interface</h2>
            <p>
                The application interface is minimalist, user friendly, thus making the user's visit a pleasant one. The
                color palette was chosen to evoke nature/animals. Also, the interface has a modern structure, such as
                the pops of the buttons on the Home page, the shadows of the text/image boxes, the pictures according to
                the described pages
            </p>
            <p>
                Each page has its own css style sheet, but for the navigation bar and for the footer we modularized the
                content, to be able to import it into the rest of the pages without duplicating the code.
            </p>

            <p>
                The application is responsive, so it can be used on both mobile phones and tablets. For this, in each
                css style sheet, special resolution cases are treated, in which each component is scaled in such a way
                that the page structure remains organized, clean and can be used by the user
            </p>
